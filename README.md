# Overview

Project focused on creating a web page using the Django framework.

A responsive web page was created with a Bootstrap template using some CSS and Javascript libraries. In addition, a database was integrated with Sqlite3, which comes by default in Python.

The purpose of this project is to investigate how to use the Python language to create a web application for more complex future projects.
